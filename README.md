# Air Hockey AI (Work in Progress)
This repository is dedicated to the development of AI agents for playing the game of Air Hockey. The goal of this project is to implement intelligent agents capable of playing Air Hockey using Q-Learning and NEAT algorithms.

# Project Overview
Air Hockey is a fast-paced game that requires quick reactions, precision, and strategic thinking. The project aims to develop AI agents capable of playing Air Hockey against either another AI agent or a human player. The agents will learn to react to the dynamics of the game, anticipate opponent movements, and make strategic decisions to score goals while defending their own goal.

# Features (Planned)
- Implementation of the Air Hockey game using PyGame library.
- Training of AI agents using Q-Learning and NEAT algorithms.
- Development of reward and penalty systems to motivate AI agents to learn optimal behavior.
- Generation of game simulations for training AI agents.
- Evaluation of AI agent performance in real-time gameplay scenarios.
- Setup Instructions
- As the game is yet to be implemented, setup instructions will be provided once the initial implementation is available.
